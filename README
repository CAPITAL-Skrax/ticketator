# Ticketator

Ticketator is a simple ticketing system developed in Python, based on Django Framework.
It is inspired in some features of Jira and other ticketing systems commonly used by IT Departments.

Ticketator behaviour is based basically, in Users, Groups and Queues. 

You can define rights to let users interact with tickets on a queue in a singular way: by example, you can define that users on a group can create new tickets, but no comment these tickets, or simply, not update a ticket once created.

Give a try to Ticketator, and give us your feedback!
